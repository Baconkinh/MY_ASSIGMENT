# Assignment 2-1: When was I born?

Student ID: 6730300655

Student Name: Atchara Dangdee

## Instructions

Write a class named `ZodiacYear` that takes the year of birth, the current year, and the name, and display the Chinese zodiac year and the age of the person.

Chinese zodiac years are in this order: Rat, Ox, Tiger, Rabbit, Dragon, Snake, Horse, Goat, Monkey, Rooster, Dog, and Pig. Year 2000 is the year of the Dragon. We disregard the month and day of birth for now.

You should copy and paste the texts from the examples to ensure that your program displays correct output.

## Conditions

- Both the year of birth and current year must be positive integers.
- The current year _must not predate_ the year of birth.

If the user violates any of these conditions, the program should display the message "Invalid input!" and terminate.

## Example Runs

### Example 1

```
Year of Birth: 2000
Current Year: 2024
Name: Birdie
Birdie was born in the year of the Dragon and is now 24 years old.
```

### Example 2

```
Year of Birth: 2024
Current Year: 2000
Invalid input!
```
